/**
 * ## AWS Cluster Service Discovery
 *
 * In this example, we are connecting to a service running on a cluster using its AWS Cloud
 * Map service host name. This is useful for service discovery.
 *
 * We are deploying a service to a cluster in a VPC. And we can access it within the VPC using
 * the service's cloud map hostname.
 *
 * ```ts title="lambda.ts"
 * const reponse = await fetch(`http://${Resource.MyService.service}`);
 * ```
 *
 * Here we are accessing it through a Lambda function that's linked to the service and is
 * deployed to the same VPC.
