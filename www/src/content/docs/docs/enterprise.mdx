import config from '../../../../config.ts';

SST is great for larger teams that have complex policy, security, and compliance requirements.

1. It runs completely on your infrastructure.
2. It's designed to work with enterprise requirements by default.
3. You can transform any component if you have custom needs.
4. You can always drop down and use Pulumi or Terraform within SST if you need to.

Feel free to open an issue on <a href={config.github}>GitHub</a> if you are having any problems with enterprise requirements.
