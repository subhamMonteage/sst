title: NestJS on AWS with SST
description: Create and deploy an NestJS app to AWS with SST.
---

We are going to build an app with NestJS, add an S3 Bucket for file uploads, and deploy it to AWS in a container with SST.

:::tip[View source]
You can [view the source](https://github.com/sst/sst/tree/dev/examples/aws-nestjs-container) of this example in our repo.
:::

Before you get started, make sure to [configure your AWS credentials](/docs/iam-credentials#credentials).

:::note
You need Node 22.12 or higher for this example to work.
:::

Also make sure you have Node 22.12. Or set the `--experimental-require-module` flag. This'll allow NestJS to import the SST SDK.

---

#### Examples

We also have a few other NestJS examples that you can refer to.

- [Build a hit counter with NestJS and Redis](/docs/examples/#aws-nestjs-with-redis)

---

## 1. Create a project

Let's start by creating our Nest app.

```bash
nest new aws-nestjs-container
cd aws-nestjs-container
```

We are picking npm as the package manager.

---

#### Init SST

Now let's initialize SST in our app.

```bash
npx sst@latest init
npm install
```

This'll create a `sst.config.ts` file in your project root.

To make sure the types in the `sst.config.ts` are picked up, add the following to the `tsconfig.json`.

```diff lang="json" title="tsconfig.json"
{
+ "include": ["src/**/*", "test/**/*", "sst-env.d.ts"]
}
```

---

## 2. Add a Service

To deploy our Nest app, let's add an [AWS Fargate](https://aws.amazon.com/fargate/) container with [Amazon ECS](https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/). Update your `sst.config.ts`.

```js title="sst.config.ts" {10-12}
async run() {
  const vpc = new sst.aws.Vpc("MyVpc");
  const cluster = new sst.aws.Cluster("MyCluster", { vpc });

  new sst.aws.Service("MyService", {
    cluster,
    loadBalancer: {
      ports: [{ listen: "80/http", forward: "3000/http" }],
    },
    dev: {
      command: "npm run start:dev",
    },
  });
}
```

This creates a VPC with an ECS Cluster, and adds a Fargate service to it.

:::note
By default, your service in not deployed when running in _dev_.
:::

The `dev.command` tells SST to instead run our Nest app locally in dev mode.

---

#### Start dev mode

Run the following to start dev mode. This'll start SST and your Nest app.

```bash
npx sst dev
```

Once complete, click on **MyService** in the sidebar and open your Nest app in your browser.

---

## 3. Add an S3 Bucket

Let's add an S3 Bucket for file uploads. Add this to your `sst.config.ts` below the `Vpc` component.

```ts title="sst.config.ts"
const bucket = new sst.aws.Bucket("MyBucket");
```

---

#### Link the bucket

Now, link the bucket to the container.

```ts title="sst.config.ts" {3}
new sst.aws.Service("MyService", {
  // ...
  link: [bucket],
});
```

This will allow us to reference the bucket in our Nest app.

---

## 4. Upload a file

We want a `POST` request made to the `/` route to upload a file to our S3 bucket. Let's add this below our `getHello` method in our `src/app.controller.ts`.

```ts title="src/app.controller.ts" {5}
@Post()
@UseInterceptors(FileInterceptor('file'))
async uploadFile(@UploadedFile() file: Express.Multer.File): Promise<string> {
  const params = {
    Bucket: Resource.MyBucket.name,
    ContentType: file.mimetype,
    Key: file.originalname,
    Body: file.buffer,
  };

  const upload = new Upload({
    params,
    client: s3,
  });

  await upload.done();

  return 'File uploaded successfully.';
}
```

:::tip
We are directly accessing our S3 bucket with `Resource.MyBucket.name`.
:::

Add the imports. We'll use the extra ones below.

```ts title="src/app.controller.ts"
import {
  S3Client,
  GetObjectCommand,
  ListObjectsV2Command,
} from '@aws-sdk/client-s3';
import { Resource } from 'sst';
import { Express } from 'express';
import { Upload } from '@aws-sdk/lib-storage';
import { FileInterceptor } from '@nestjs/platform-express';
import { getSignedUrl } from '@aws-sdk/s3-request-presigner';
import { Post, Redirect, UploadedFile, UseInterceptors } from '@nestjs/common';

const s3 = new S3Client({});
```

And install the npm packages.

```bash
npm install -D @types/multer
npm install @aws-sdk/client-s3 @aws-sdk/lib-storage @aws-sdk/s3-request-presigner
```

---

## 5. Download the file

We'll add a `/latest` route that'll download the latest file in our S3 bucket. Let's add this below our `uploadFile` method in `src/app.controller.ts`.

```ts title="src/app.controller.ts"
@Get('latest')
@Redirect('/', 302)
async getLatestFile() {
  const objects = await s3.send(
    new ListObjectsV2Command({
      Bucket: Resource.MyBucket.name,
    }),
  );

  const latestFile = objects.Contents.sort(
    (a, b) => b.LastModified.getTime() - a.LastModified.getTime(),
  )[0];

  const command = new GetObjectCommand({
    Key: latestFile.Key,
    Bucket: Resource.MyBucket.name,
  });
  const url = await getSignedUrl(s3, command);

  return { url };
}
```

---

#### Test your app

To upload a file run the following from your project root.

```bash
curl -F file=@package.json http://localhost:3000/
```

This should upload the `package.json`. Now head over to `http://localhost:3000/latest` in your browser and it'll download you what you just uploaded.

---

## 5. Deploy your app

To deploy our app we'll first add a `Dockerfile`.

```dockerfile title="Dockerfile"
FROM node:22

WORKDIR /usr/src/app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install
COPY . .
RUN npm run build

EXPOSE 3000
CMD ["node", "dist/main"]
```

This just builds our Nest app in a Docker image.

:::tip
You need to be running [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) to deploy your app.
:::

Let's also add a `.dockerignore` file in the root.

```bash title=".dockerignore"
dist
node_modules
```

Now to build our Docker image and deploy we run:

```bash
npx sst deploy --stage production
```

You can use any stage name here but it's good to create a new stage for production. This'll give the URL of your Nest app deployed as a Fargate service.

```bash
âœ“  Complete
   MyService: http://jayair-MyServiceLoadBala-592628062.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com
```

---

## Connect the console

As a next step, you can setup the [SST Console](/docs/console/) to _**git push to deploy**_ your app and monitor it for any issues. 

![SST Console Autodeploy](../../../../../assets/docs/start/sst-console-autodeploy.png)

You can [create a free account](https://console.sst.dev) and connect it to your AWS account.
