SST v3 now supports the [`go`](/docs/component/aws/function#runtime) runtime for your Lambda functions. Golang is a great option for tasks that are more compute intensive and it also has faster cold starts. We talk about it here:

You can use Go in SST by setting the `runtime` prop and pointing the `handler` to the directory with your Go function.

```ts title="sst.config.ts"
new sst.aws.Function("MyFunction", {
  runtime: "go",
  link: [bucket],
  handler: "./src"
});
```

For more details, check out our [**Go example**](/docs/examples/#aws-lambda-go).

Also in this update:

1. The [`sst dev`](/docs/reference/cli/#dev) CLI supports running your Go functions [_Live_](/docs/live/).

2. You can use our new [Go SDK](/docs/reference/sdk/#golang) to access linked resources in your Go functions or container applications.

   ```go title="src/main.go"
   import (
     "github.com/sst/sst/v3/sdk/golang/resource"
   )
   
   resource.Get("MyBucket", "name")
   ```
   
   The Go SDK does not support the [clients](/docs/reference/sdk/#clients) that are available in the JS SDK.

3. You can view Go function logs in the [Console](/docs/console/). Support for [Issues](/docs/console/#issues) is coming soon.
