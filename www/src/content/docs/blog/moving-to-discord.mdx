We are moving our Slack community to [Discord](https://discord.gg/sst)! While our Slack community has grown to over 2000 members, we feel that Discord is better aligned with supporting open source communities.

To join our Discord server, head over to: [**discord.gg/sst**](https://discord.gg/sst)

If you are curious about why we are moving to Discord, I [shared some thoughts on this on Twitter](https://x.com/jayair/status/1535360228631379973).

We hope to see you in [Discord](https://discord.gg/sst) soon!

PS: The Slack community will be around while we transition.
