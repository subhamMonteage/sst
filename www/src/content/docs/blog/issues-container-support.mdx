[Issues](/docs/console#issues) now reports errors from Node.js container applications. Previously, only errors from Lambda functions were reported.

### Reporting errors

For the Console to automatically report errors, you need to `console.error` an error object.

```js title="src/index.ts"
console.error(new Error("my-error"));
```

In container applications, your code needs to also import the [SST JS SDK](/docs/reference/sdk/).

```js title="src/index.ts" {1}
import "sst";

console.error(new Error("my-error"));
```

This applies a polyfill to the `console` object to prepend the log lines with a marker that allows Issues to detect errors.

:::note
You'll need to update your SDK version to `3.9.24` or higher.
:::

If you are already importing the SDK, you won't need to add an additional import.

### How it works

Issues works by adding a log subscriber to the CloudWatch Log groups in your SST apps. This has a filter that matches anything that looks like an error.

In the case of Lambda functions, the Lambda runtime automatically adds a marker to the logs that the filter matches for. For containers, the SST SDK polyfills the `console` object to add the marker.
