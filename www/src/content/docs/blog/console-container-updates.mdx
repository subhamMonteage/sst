We are rolling out some updates to the [Console](/docs/console) to better support container applications.

### Logs

You can now see **logs from your containers** in the Console. In addition to the logs from your functions. Head over to your **App** > **Stage** > **Logs**.

As a bonus, you can see logs from any CloudWatch log group that your app creates.

### Autodeploy

The Console can auto-deploy your apps when you _git push_ to your GitHub repo. We added the following updates recently.

- **VPC**: You can now configure Autodeploy to run in your VPC using [`autodeploy.runner.vpc`](/docs/reference/config#vpc). This is useful if your builds need to access private resources.
- **Caching**: You can now configure files or directories to be cached as a part of your build process with [`autodeploy.runner.cache`](/docs/reference/config#cache). This can help speed up builds.
- **Extended timeouts**: Autodeploys now have a maximum timeout of 36 hours. This is useful for apps that take a long time to build.
- **New runner sizes**: There are new `xlarge` and `2xlarge` sizes with around 70GB and 145GB of memory; helpful for large applications.

Check out the updated [`console.autodeploy`](/docs/reference/config#console-autodeploy) config.

### Other updates

While not strictly related to containers we also added support for:

- **Manual deploys**: You can now manually trigger a deployment from **App** > **Autodeploy** > hitting the **Deploy** button. You can pass in a Git ref and the stage you want to deploy to.
- **Redeploys**: You can now redeploy any past deploy through the Console.
- **Cancel deploys**: You can also cancel a deploy that's in progress through the Console.

### About Autodeploy

If you haven't used Autodeploy before, we designed it to be a better fit for SST apps when compared to alternatives like GitHub Actions or CircleCI.

1. **Easy to get started**, supports branch and PR workflow out of the box.
2. **Configurable**, customize your workflow through your `sst.config.ts`.
3. **Runs in your AWS account**, builds are run in your AWS account and can use your VPC.

And it integrates with the rest of the SST Console. [Learn more about Autodeploy](/docs/console#autodeploy) to get started.
