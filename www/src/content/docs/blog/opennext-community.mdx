We launched [OpenNext](https://opennext.js.org) back in April 2023 to build an open-source adapter for Next.js.

Thanks to our community, most notable [conico974](https://github.com/conico974) and [khuezy](https://github.com/khuezy), it's now the best way to deploy your Next.js apps on AWS.

Today OpenNext is **joined by Cloudflare and Netlify**; making it a broader community effort. They'll be publishing their adapters through OpenNext as well.

You can support the community by:

- Following OpenNext on GitHub: [github.com/opennextjs](https://github.com/opennextjs)
- Joining the new Discord server: [discord.gg/opennextjs](https://discord.gg/opennextjs)

It's been great to see the community take shape around the project.
