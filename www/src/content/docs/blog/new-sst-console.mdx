The new SST Console is out. You can [learn more](/docs/console/) about it over on our docs.

### What is the SST Console

The SST Console is a web based dashboard to manage your SST apps. With it you can invoke functions, debug issues, view logs, and manage all your apps with your team â€” [**console.sst.dev**](https://console.sst.dev/)

### Features

#### Logs

With the SST Console, you don't need to go to CloudWatch to look at the logs for your functions. It also supports a couple of modes; _recent_, _live_, and _time intervals_.

#### Issues

The SST Console will automatically show you any errors in your Lambda functions in real-time. There is:
  - **Nothing to setup**, no code to instrument
  - **Source maps** are supported **automatically**, no need to upload
  - **No impact on performance** or cold starts, since the functions aren't modified

#### Local logs

When the Console starts up, it checks if you are running `sst dev` locally. If so, then it'll show you real-time logs from your local terminal.

### Open source

The Console is built with SST, deployed with [Seed](https://seed.run), and you can [view the source on GitHub](https://github.com/sst/console).

The codebase is also a good example of what a production SST app looks like.

### Your team and AWS accounts

You can create a workspace in the Console, invite your team, and connect all your AWS accounts. It'll automatically discover your SST apps.

### Pricing

The SST Console pricing is based on the number of times the Lambda functions in your SST apps are invoked per month. It comes with a free tier of 1M invocations.

You can [read more about it over on the docs](/docs/console/#pricing).

### Old Console

The old SST Console is still accessible at [old.console.sst.dev](https://old.console.sst.dev). But we'll be moving away from it in the future.
