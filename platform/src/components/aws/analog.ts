 *
 * Deploy an Analog app that's in the project root.
 *
 * ```js title="sst.config.ts"
 * new sst.aws.Analog("MyWeb");
 * ```
 *
 * #### Change the path
 *
 * Deploys the Analog app in the `my-analog-app/` directory.
 *
 * ```js {2} title="sst.config.ts"
 * new sst.aws.Analog("MyWeb", {
 *   path: "my-analog-app/"
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * #### Add a custom domain
 *
 * Set a custom domain for your Analog app.
 *
 * ```js {2} title="sst.config.ts"
 * new sst.aws.Analog("MyWeb", {
 *   domain: "my-app.com"
 * });

 * #### Redirect www to apex domain
 *

 *
 * ```js {4} title="sst.config.ts"
 * new sst.aws.Analog("MyWeb", {
 *   domain: {
 *     name: "my-app.com",

 *   }
 * });

 *
 * #### Link resources
 *
 * [Link resources](/docs/linking/) to your Analog app. This will grant permissions
 * to the resources and allow you to access it in your app.
 *
 * ```ts {4} title="sst.config.ts"
 * const bucket = new sst.aws.Bucket("MyBucket");
 *
 * new sst.aws.Analog("MyWeb", {
 *   link: [bucket]
 * });
 * ```

 * in your Analog app.
