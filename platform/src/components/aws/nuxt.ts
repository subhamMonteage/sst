/**
 * The `Nuxt` component lets you deploy a [Nuxt](https://nuxt.com) app to AWS.
 *
 * @example
 *
 * #### Minimal example
 *
 * Deploy a Nuxt app that's in the project root.
 *
 * ```js title="sst.config.ts"
 * new sst.aws.Nuxt("MyWeb");
 * ```
 *
 * #### Change the path
 *
 * Deploys the Nuxt app in the `my-nuxt-app/` directory.
 *
 * ```js {2} title="sst.config.ts"
 * new sst.aws.Nuxt("MyWeb", {
 *   path: "my-nuxt-app/"
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * #### Add a custom domain
 *
 * Set a custom domain for your Nuxt app.
 *
 * ```js {2} title="sst.config.ts"
 * new sst.aws.Nuxt("MyWeb", {
 *   domain: "my-app.com"
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * #### Redirect www to apex domain
 *
 * Redirect `www.my-app.com` to `my-app.com`.
 *
 * ```js {4} title="sst.config.ts"
 * new sst.aws.Nuxt("MyWeb", {
 *   domain: {
 *     name: "my-app.com",
 *     redirects: ["www.my-app.com"]
 *   }
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * #### Link resources
 *
 * [Link resources](/docs/linking/) to your Nuxt app. This will grant permissions
 * to the resources and allow you to access it in your app.
 *
 * ```ts {4} title="sst.config.ts"
 * const bucket = new sst.aws.Bucket("MyBucket");
 *
 * new sst.aws.Nuxt("MyWeb", {
 *   link: [bucket]
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * You can use the [SDK](/docs/reference/sdk/) to access the linked resources
 * in your Nuxt app.
 *
 * ```ts title="server/api/index.ts"
 * import { Resource } from "sst";
 *
 * console.log(Resource.MyBucket.name);
 * ```
 *
 * #### Configure base path
 *
 * To serve your Nuxt app from a subpath (e.g., `https://my-app.com/docs`), you need to configure both Nuxt and SST settings.
 *
 * Step 1: Configure Nuxt base path
 *
 * Set the `baseURL` option in your Nuxt app's `nuxt.config.ts` without a trailing slash:
 * ```js {3} title="nuxt.config.ts"
 * export default defineConfig({
 *   app: {
 *     baseURL: "/docs",
 *   },
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * Step 2: Disable CDN on the Nuxt component
 *
 * In your SST configuration:
 * ```js {2} title="sst.config.ts"
 * const docs = new sst.aws.Nuxt("Docs", {
 *   cdn: false,
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * Step 3: Add the site to a Router
 *
 * Finally, route the Nuxt app through a Router component:
 * ```js {2}
 * const router = new sst.aws.Router("MyRouter", {
 *   domain: "my-app.com",
 * });
 * router.routeSite("/docs", docs);
 * ```
